Required:

The Luggage - https://github.com/unixorn/luggage/wiki
Xcode (For the Make functionality)

Directions:
1.  Clone this git repo to your local machine.

2.  Put the new OS X native LabStats installer in the same directory as the Makefile.  Make sure the LABSTATS_PACKAGE_NAME variable in the Makefile is correct.

3.  Edit the host.txt file in the root of the Labstats installer package and make sure that it matches your server ip/port.

4.  Edit the Makefile and make sure the PACKAGE_VERSION number is correct.

5.  From Terminal, cd into the directory where you put the Makefile and type 'make pkg'.

6.  It *should* spit out a proper Apple Package and be good to go.
