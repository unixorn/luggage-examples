# changes to suite your build and network and post action requirements.

# You will want to change reverse domain name (provided as an argument to the script).
# In addition, if you are behind a proxy, you will want to uncomment those lines
# and make changes which are relivent for yor systems network and proxy server.

# Uncomment to set enviroment varibles (to override script defaults).

# If you are behind the proxy then issue the following commands : 
# export http_proxy="http://user:pass@proxy:3128"
# export https_proxy="http://user:pass@proxy:3128"

# change directory
cd "`dirname \"$0\"`"

./build_latest_firefox_with_default_system_proxy.bash com.example

# Add on any post actions you would like to take place once your 
# build of FireFox has completed successfully.

# Example (1) : If you would like to use rsync to copy the latest build to remote server.
#               Please note that if you uncomment the command (two lines) a password may be required. 
#               Should you uncommon, then ensure you test the script works prior automating.
#               Also, prior to automating this script think about the security implications.
# Modify the following lines appropriately and then modify and uncomment the following command : 
# echo -n "Upload .dmg to server ? [Y/n] : "
# read result
# if [ "${result}" == "" ] || [ "${result}" == "y" ] || [ "${result}" == "yes" ] || [ "${result}" == "Y" ] || [ "${result}" == "YES" ] ; then
