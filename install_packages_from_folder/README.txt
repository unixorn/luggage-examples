This luggage example will build a package which will when executed will
attempt to install any .pkg or .mpkg files found within the additional
packages directory. Packages within this directory (within the built
package) may be updated and altered prior to installation of the package.

For a future version it would be ideal if an external directory or URL
could be specified. In addition, downloading of InstallPKG as and when
required would also be ideal.
