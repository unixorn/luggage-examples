#  Example:  A dynamic installer for Puppet
#
#  Author:  Gary Larizza
#  Created: 12/17/2010

#
#  Description:  This Makefile will download the version of Puppet specified
#    in the PACKAGE_VERSION variable from the Puppet Labs website, untar it,
#    and then install the source files into their Mac-specific locations.  
#    The MAJOR and MINOR versions must be specified for the Info.plist file
#    that Packagemaker requires, but I use awk on the PACKAGE_VERSION to 
#    get these.  See inline comments.
