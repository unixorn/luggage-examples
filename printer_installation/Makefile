# Example: Printer Creation Example
# Author: Gary Larizza
# Description: This package will use a preflight script to setup the actual printer
#				and then dump a pre-created .ppd file into the appropriate directory
#				to set all the printer settings.  This worked much better than lpadmin
#				commands for me (and was easier).  Note that you could also copy over
#				custom printer definition files if they aren't pre-installed with OS X.

# A preflight script (named 'preflight') sets up the printer, and the .ppd file copied in the next step
#   will customize your settings.  To create this package, first customize the preflight script and 
#   then customize your printer with whatever settings you need.  The custom .ppd file located in 
#   /etc/cups/ppd/ and should be copied to your working directory.  Change the .ppd filename
#   to match your printer name (from the preflight script) and you should be fine.
